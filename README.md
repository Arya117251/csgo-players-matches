# 🎮 CS:GO Player Performance Analysis
Analysis of CS:GO players and matches dataset for tournament and performance insights
A data-driven approach to analyze and predict **Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)** player performance.  
This project uses real player and match data to explore stats, engineer features, visualize trends, and apply machine learning models.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data handling & feature engineering  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** → Machine learning (Linear Regression, evaluation)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Interactive analysis

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **Data Handling**  
   - Imported CSV datasets with `pandas.read_csv()`  
   - Cleaned missing values and standardized formats  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Kill/Death (K/D) Difference  
   - Kills per Round  
   - Headshot Ratio  
   - Damage per Round
   - MOTM Awards

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized trends using Seaborn plots  
   - Correlation analysis between player metrics  

4. **Modeling**  
   - Linear Regression for predicting player performance based on features  
   - Evaluated predictive power of engineered stats
